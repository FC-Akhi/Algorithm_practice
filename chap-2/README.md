### Goal is this chapter

#### Sorting Algorithms: Insertion Sort and Merge Sort

In this section, we will dive into the world of sorting algorithms, focusing on two key methods: **Insertion Sort and Merge Sort**. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just getting started, the pseudocode and explanations provided will help you understand these algorithms thoroughly.

**- Insertion Sort**

Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. 

Correctness: We will walk through why Insertion Sort correctly sorts a list of items. By repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into its proper place, the list gradually becomes sorted.
Running Time Analysis: Understanding how the running time of Insertion Sort grows with the number of items being sorted is crucial. We'll introduce a notation that helps describe this growth, providing a foundation for analyzing more complex algorithms.


**- Merge Sort**

Merge Sort employs a strategy called divide-and-conquer to sort a list efficiently:

Divide-and-Conquer Method: This powerful method involves breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem. Merge Sort uses this approach to sort lists in a highly efficient manner.

Running Time Analysis: We will also analyze the running time of Merge Sort, demonstrating how its efficiency compares to simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort.
By the end of this section, you will not only understand how Insertion Sort and Merge Sort work but also how to analyze their performance. This knowledge will equip you with the tools to tackle more complex sorting problems and optimize your algorithms effectively.

Happy coding!
